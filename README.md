Created XModule prototypes for improving my university's mobile app with the Modo Labs Platform. Modules created using Node.js and integrated mock json data and API's for demonstration and functionality. Hosted using AWS lambda servers and local machine ngrok server technologies.

The Organizations module implements mock json data of orgs from the university. The module displays a list these orgs which branch out into links within the app on click.
