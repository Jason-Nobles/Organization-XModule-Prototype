Created XModule prototypes for improving my university's mobile app with the Modo Labs Platform. Module created using Node.js and integrated mock json data for demonstration and functionality.
Hosted using AWS Serverless tools.
The Organizations module implements mock json data of orgs from the university. The module displays a list of these orgs which branch out to view the associated content.
