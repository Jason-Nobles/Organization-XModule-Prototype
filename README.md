Created XModule prototypes for improving my university's mobile app with the Modo Labs Platform. Modules created using Node.js, integrated mock json data, and API's for demonstration and functionality. Hosted using AWS Serverless and local machine ngrok servers.

The Organizations module implements mock json data of orgs from the university. The module displays a list of these orgs which branch out to view the associated content.
